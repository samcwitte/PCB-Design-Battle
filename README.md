# PCB-Design-Battle

This is a repository containing my PCB designs for a 2-hour PCB battle I participated in with [Predictable Designs on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@PredictableDesigns).

The video hasn't been released yet, but I'll update this line when it is.[]()

## Summary

This design battle was to take place over the course of 2 hours, during which the participants and I would have to complete the schematic capture and PCB layout. Here's the design guidelines we were given:

`"Design a small, battery-powered PCB that reads temperature and sends the data wirelessly to a mobile app. The device must also indicate the temperature locally, this could be a display, an LED (flashing speed or color indicates temp), or something else creative. You can use any MCU, sensor, wireless method, and battery type (rechargeable, coin cells, or alkalines). You have 2 hours to complete the design."`

There are two folders in this repository.
- `ESP_32_Battle` is my official end result of the 2 hour battle
- `ESP_32_Battle_4h` is the result of giving myself an additional 2 hours to work on the PCB

I took inspiration from a few of my previous ESP32 designs, of which this board shares many similarities.

While I hope they would work if made, I make no guarantees to the functionality of these PCBs.
